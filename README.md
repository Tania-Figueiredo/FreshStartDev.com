#  FreshStart Dev

Welcome to **FreshStart Dev** — my personal space on the web.  
It’s where I share my projects, learning journey, and the path I’m building as a **Front-End Developer & Product Builder** based in Portugal 🇵🇹.

---

##  Project Overview

**FreshStart Dev** isn’t just a portfolio — it’s a product I designed, coded, and deployed to reflect how I work and grow.  
The site is fully live and functional, but constantly evolving as I improve design, structure, and user experience over time.

## Pages & Structure

-  **Home:** minimalist landing page introducing the project  
-  **About:** my story, mindset, and approach to building digital products  
-  **Portfolio:** professional and personal projects  
-  **Contact:** simple Netlify form with direct links to my social platforms

##  Continuous Improvements

-  Frequent content and layout updates  
-  SEO and accessibility refinements  
-  Performance tuning for faster load times  
-  Adding new sections and case studies (next: RaceCrew AI & Sorika App)

##  Tech Stack

- **HTML5** — semantic and accessible structure  
- **CSS3 + Variables** — custom color system & responsive layouts  
- **Bootstrap 5** — grid and components for consistent UI  
- **Google Fonts:** [Playfair Display](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playfair+Display) & [Poppins](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins)  
- **Netlify** — deployment and form handling
